Bell peppers, whether green, red, orange, or yellow, keep for up to two weeks in the fridge with very little intervention. Just put them in a plastic bag in your [crisper drawer](/crisper_drawer). The same goes for hotter chile peppers, from habaneros to jalape√±os.

If you want to store them for longer, you can freeze peppers pretty easily. Wash them, remove the seeds and membranes, slice them into whatever size you prefer, then freeze them flat on a baking sheet. Once they're frozen through, put them in a freezer bag and stash them in the freezer for up to six months. Chiles can also be frozen sliced or whole, or you can preserve them by macerating them in citrus juice or vinegar to make pickled chiles.
