# {{ $doc.title }}

Some dishes, like this silky cauliflower soup, mercifully call for an entire unit of produce (in this case, a whole head of cauliflower). But most recipes leave you with odds and ends — a couple of wilting scallions, half a sliced tomato, a few carrots — languishing in the crisper. Rescue these orphan veggies with catchall dishes that make use of whatever you have. "I am a big fan of garbage soups," Karnasiewicz says. "Every other day or so I will start a pot of something on the stove and just keep throwing things in."
Other catchall, veggie-forward dishes include fried rice (this gingery fried brown rice would play well with sautéed bell peppers, bok choy, or leafy greens), stir-fry, lasagna, and flatbreads. "The other day I made pizza dough topped with two inches of a heel of salami, the butt of a fennel bulb, and half a red onion," Karnasiewicz says. "It turned out great." Eggs are also a catchall hero. Tuck a few of last night's roasted potatoes, those yellowing florets of broccoli, and the dregs of a batch of roasted red peppers into a frittata or scramble. Top everything with cheese and bake your way to a delightful dinner.
