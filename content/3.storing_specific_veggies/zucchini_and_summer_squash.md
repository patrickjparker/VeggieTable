Summer squashes, like zucchini and yellow squash, are more tender than their winter cousins. Wipe them clean and store in a plastic bag with one end open in the crisper drawer. Optimally, you would eat them within five days. Zucchinis can last a week or two, but they may begin to shrivel up a bit after a week. Summer squashes also freeze pretty well — just slice them, blanch them, and freeze them. They'll keep for about three months.
