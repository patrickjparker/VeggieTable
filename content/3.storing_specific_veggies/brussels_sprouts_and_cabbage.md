Ever think about how brussels sprouts are just tiny cabbages? Like cabbages for gerbils! Cute! Anyway, you can store them in a plastic bag in the fridge. They'll last at least a week, up to two weeks. Sprouts on the stalk keep longer, but I've only ever seen them sold like that in real life once, so don't worry about it too much.
A whole head of cabbage, whether red, green, Napa, or Savoy, is a great vegetable to grab because it lasts a long time. All you need to do is keep it in its plastic wrap (or wrap it yourself if it didn't come in such coverings) or a resealable plastic bag and place it in the fridge. The crisper drawer is ideal, but cabbages can be large lads, so don't fret if it doesn't fit. It'll stay fresh for two to three weeks.
