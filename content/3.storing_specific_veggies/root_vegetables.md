These are carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets, radishes, rutabagas, sweet potatoes, yams, and regular old potatoes.

## Potatoes and Sweet Potatoes

What's great about these varieties is that, in many cases, you don't even need to keep them in the fridge. If you have a cool, dry spot in your house, like a garage, cellar, or closet, where the temperature is consistently between 40 and 50 degrees, you can keep potatoes and sweet potatoes in a paper bag there for up to three months without them spoiling. Avoid damp, cool places, however — those mimic potato growing conditions, and will encourage them to sprout. Large potatoes tend to last longer than baby ones.

## Carrots, Parsnips, and Turnips

Carrots, parsnips, and turnips are best kept in the fridge wrapped in a slightly damp paper towel or dishcloth — just remove their leafy tops first, if they came with them. They'll last there for three to four weeks.

## Beets and Celeriac

Beets and celeriac also can be kept in a damp, clean towel in the fridge, minus their leaves, where they'll last about 10 to 14 days. For radishes, remove their greens and then put them in a resealable plastic bag with a folded damp paper towel. They'll also be good for up to two weeks.

You don't have to throw away the greens you're removing, either — freeze them in a bag for stock or throw them into a greens-heavy sauce, like a pesto, salsa, or gremolata.
