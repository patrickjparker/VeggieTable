The first step to working with mushrooms is to buy good ones. What to look for depends on which kind of mushrooms you're buying. Here are some tips for a few of the most common varieties:

## Cremini
For white or cremini mushrooms, make sure they are firm, plump and clean. The cap should be attached to the stem.

## Portobello
Give portobello mushrooms a sniff. They should smell like the earth and have fresh-looking gills.

## Shiitake
Shiitake mushrooms should have smooth, firm caps and should be tender, not dry but not slimy.
