Whether is a vegetable that has been sitting in the fridge for too long, or a scrap that you would normally throw away, there are many ways to use food that would otherwise go to waste. Here are some ideas:

- [Cook them into something that will last longer](using_scraps_and_old_veggies/cook)
- [Save the Scrapes for a Stock](using_scraps_and_old_veggies/stock)
- [Embrace catch-all recipes](using_scraps_and_old_veggies/catch_all_dishes)
- [Regrow vegetables from scraps](using_scraps_and_old_veggies/regrow)
