There are too many to cover here but [here](https://naturezedge.com/how-to-grow-vegetables-and-fruits-from-scraps) is a longer list with instructions on how to regrow them. Here we'll cover a few general tips plus those can be regrown entirely in your kitchen.

## General Tips

Although there are differences between vegetables, most of the time, regrowing vegetables from scraps is as simple as:

1. Take the base of the vegetable (the part you would normally throw away) and place it in a container with a little bit of water.
2. Place the container in a sunny spot and change the water every few days.

Most vegetables will start to regrow within a few days. Once they have a few inches of growth, you can transplant them into soil.

Other tips:
- Chose organic vegetables when possible. They are more likely to regrow because they haven't been treated with chemicals that prevent growth.

## Regrowing Vegetables in Your Kitchen

Of these vegetables, there are a few that can be regrown entirely in your kitchen. These are:
- Lettuce
- Celery
- Bok Choy
- Cabbage
- Lemongrass
- Fennel
- Green Onions/Scallions

For all of these vegetables, you want to do the following:

1. Cut off the bottom of the vegetable.
2. Place the bottom in a container with the cut side up and a little bit of water.
3. Place in a sunny spot and change the water every few days.

Once the vegetable has roots you can transplant it into soil, but you can also just leave it in the container with water.

### Herbs

Another popular thing to regrow are herbs. A few of the most popular herbs to regrow are:
- Basil
- Cilantro
- Mint
- Rosemary
- Thyme

These do great with the same treatment as the vegetables above with two differences:
- Cut the place a few inches below it's highest set of leaves. You'll want to make sure you have a least an ince of stem below the junction of a leaf and the stem.
- Once the roots are a few inches long, transplant them into soil.
