One of the first few harbingers of spring, it's also one that gets limp fairly quickly in the refrigerator. Like your tender, leafy greens, asparagus is best eaten fairly quickly after you buy it, but you can prolong its life a bit. When you get a bunch of asparagus, trim off about an inch from the bottoms of the stalks. Then set the whole bunch upright in a water glass or mason jar, keeping about two inches of water at the bottom, like you would a bunch of herbs or flowers. Stick the jar in the fridge. Loosely cover the tops of the stalks with a plastic bag and change the water if it gets cloudy.
