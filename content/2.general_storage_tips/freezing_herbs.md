Fresh herbs are more delicate than hearty vegetables and susceptible to freezer-burn. Ice cube trays are perfect for the job. Mince the herbs as finely as you can and fill your tray about ¾ of the way full. Top the herbs off with olive oil to best preserve flavor, but water works, too. Freeze until solid, then transfer the frozen herb cubes to a storage container. Now you’ll have perfectly portioned herbs to add to your favorite recipes. There’s no need to thaw in most cases — simply add to your skillet or pot and let it melt.
