These similar-looking vegetables are both from the crucifer family and require similar storage methods. For both, whole heads keep a lot longer than bags of pre-cut florets. The best way to store broccoli or cauliflower is loosely in a plastic bag; skip washing until right before you need them. They'll keep for a week or more, but are tastiest sooner rather than later.

Broccoli and cauliflower are also great candidates for freezing. Just break them up into florets, put them on a sheet pan in the freezer, and then transfer them to a freezer bag once they're solidly frozen. Eat within six months for the best flavor.
