Limp celery is truly a sad thing to behold. To keep your celery crisp, as my former colleague Maxine Builder wrote, you have to keep it hydrated. It's the water pressure in celery cells that give it that delightful crunch. Keeping it wrapped in foil in the fridge does the trick â€” wrap it well but don't crimp the edges. You want moisture to stay in, but not to trap the ethylene gas celery emits. Stalks of celery also keep well either in a sealed zip-top plastic bag or submerged in a Mason jar or a quart container. If your celery has already gone limp, soak it in water for an hour or two to partially revive it.
