For winter squashes, you don't even need a refrigerator. A cool spot in your house will work just fine, as long as you keep them off the floor for air circulation — a rack is ideal. Keep the skin dry, and keep the squash away from fruits that off-gases as they ripen, like apples, avocados, and bananas. Watch for spots — if you see a squash develop spots, take it away from the other squashes, as it may be developing rot. If you do see a spot, it's OK — just wipe down the squash with a very gentle bleach solution, one part bleach to 10 parts water, and make sure to peel or scrub thoroughly before you eat it. Most winter squashes keep up to six months in these conditions, but acorn squashes you'll want to eat a little sooner, between one and two months.
