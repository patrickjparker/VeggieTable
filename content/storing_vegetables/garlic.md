Another hardy, flavor-packed ingredient, garlic bulbs can keep up to six months when stored properly. Buy garlic whole, if you can, and not pre-peeled or minced. Then keep it in a dark, dry spot to prevent sprouting. If you have more garlic than you know what to do with, try making garlic confit and keeping it in the oil it's cooked in. It'll keep for about four months.
