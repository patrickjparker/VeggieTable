Keep mushrooms in the fridge, not at room temperature. They'll be fine in the package they came in if you bought a plastic-wrapped container at the supermarket. If you got them loose, brush off as much dirt as you can, but don't wash them. Put them in a paper bag and pop them in the refrigerator. Mushrooms don't freeze well, sadly, so use them within a week of purchasing, if you can.

Mushrooms should go in a breathable paper bag, not plastic," Israel says. "They last much longer that way."
