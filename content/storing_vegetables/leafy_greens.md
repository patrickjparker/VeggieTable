Spinach, salad greens, lettuces, and other leafy greens fall into this category. They're delicate, and they're prone to wilting and rotting.

The best time to extend their life is as soon as you return from your grocery run (or receive your delivery). First, open the container the greens came in and sort through them. Any leaf that has started to turn mushy and brown should be rooted out and discarded. Second, prevent spoilage by adding paper towels or a clean dishcloth to absorb the excess moisture in the bag. If the greens are in a clamshell container, line that container with dry paper towels or a clean dish towel before putting the greens back in. If they're in a bag, you can simply fold up a paper towel, put it in the bag, and seal the bag with a clip. Use within a week.

Some lettuces are hardier than others. Lettuce that comes in a head, like romaine or iceberg, can keep up to a couple of weeks in the fridge. To keep it fresh as long as you can, cut off the ends but otherwise leave it intact. Don't wash those suckers until you're ready to use them. Store them in a plastic bag with a paper towel stuffed inside. Put the bag in the [crisper drawer](/crisper_drawer).

Also, Keep your lettuce away from fruits like apples, bananas, and avocados â€” they emit gases when they ripen that can hasten the demise of your lettuce.
