If you're getting your cucumbers from the store, you probably don't have to wash them before storing them. But if they're from a farmer's market or garden, wash and dry them thoroughly to get rid of any lingering dirt that might cling to them and quicken their spoilage. Then you have a few options. You can pop them in the fridge wrapped in a paper towel or clean dishcloth, or you can keep them on your counter. If you bought them in a plastic bag, open them and stick them in a folded dry paper towel to ward off moisture. Either way, keep them away from those off-gassing fruits I mentioned in the tender greens section and eat them within five days.

Alternatively, you can store them for longer by turning cucumbers into [easy, spicy pickles](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/spicy-dill-quick-pickles).
