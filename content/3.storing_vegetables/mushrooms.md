# {{ $doc.title }}

Keep mushrooms in the fridge, not at room temperature. They'll be fine in the package they came in if you bought a plastic-wrapped container at the supermarket. If you got them loose, brush off as much dirt as you can, but don't wash them. Put them in a breathable paper bag and pop them in the refrigerator. Mushrooms don't freeze well, sadly, so use them within a week of purchasing, if you can.
