If you live near a cornfield or farm, you might be familiar with the school of thought on cooking corn that is, basically, don't pick an ear until the pot of water is already boiling. Unfortunately, I live nowhere near a cornfield, so I just get mine from the supermarket, sometimes from a farm stand. But the adage does indicate something true about corn: It's sweetest right after it's picked, and the longer it sits in storage, the starchier it becomes. That's OK for some purposes, like baking, but if you have fresh sweet corn, it's better not to delay eating it too much. 

If you get the corn in a husk, keep it in there, and stick it in the fridge until you're ready to peel and cook it. If not, keep it wrapped in a plastic bag and enjoy it within a week. If you want to keep your corn for more long-term storage, you can freeze it. Just blanch the ears of corn by dunking them in a pot of boiling water for a minute or so, dry them thoroughly, and freeze the whole cobs. If you'd prefer, you can also strip the kernels off the cob after you blanch the corn and freeze just the kernels in a resealable freezer bag for up to a year.
