If you want salad leaves or leafy greens to last longer, consider choosing whole heads or bunches, rather than bagged greens. According to Havern, cutting or chopping produce changes the leaf's biochemistry, making the tissues vulnerable to bacterial contamination. Specifically, the cells in the tissues release their contents, which serve as food for spoilage microorganisms, says Worobo. And since the leaves in bags and boxes are often pre-cut, they generally have a shorter shelf life (three to five days) than whole heads (one to two weeks) after the date of purchase. Thus, buying whole heads of lettuce or bunches of spinach will let you determine when the leaves are cut. Not to mention, whole uncut vegetables are usually cheaper, so the switch will also help you save money on groceries.
